FT231X UART USB Power Switch
================================
![FT231X UART USB Power Switch](https://github.com/paulsykes/ft231x_uart_usb_power_switch/releases/download/v0.50.0/ft231x_breakout_usb_power_switch.jpg)

FT231X USB to serial UART with integrated current limited USB power switch.

It also allows you to switch on and off power to a USB powered device. This is super useful if you are debugging the serial output of a device during hard reset conditions and wish to automate the reset process, even more so if the device you are trying to monitor is connected to a remote computer.

- USB to UART
- USB power output switched by FT231X CBUS0 pin
- Active low, over current status readable by FT231X CBUS3 pin (500 mA)
- Solder jumper to default USB power to on or off
- USB data lines are connected to the FT231X, they are *NOT* passed through to the power switchable USB Type A port.
